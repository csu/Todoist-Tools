Electromagnetic Waves in Plane Waves
Polarization (Linear, Circular)
Polarizers and Intensity
Colors of Spectrum
Basic Reflection and Refraction (compute angles, Fermat/Huygens, sketch, total internal reflection, Brewsterâ€™s Angle)
Mirrors and Lenses (multiple, i, o, f, magnification, draw diagram
Eye placement to see image
Thin Film Interference (effect of reflection and thickness)
Double Slit Interference (comput angle, distance of bright, dark spots)
Phasors for multiple slits (patterns and intensity)
